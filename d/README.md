# dlang

I'm pretty sure this language is magical.
Somehow, things just kinda work.
A lot of my guesses just turn out to be correct on how to do things.
I guess people spent a lot of time making it intuitive.
Learning this language is pretty frictionless.
`dmd` is super fast. Not sure about the quality of the binaries but the speed
is great for a language as high level as this.

Pain rating: A little less painful than Java
