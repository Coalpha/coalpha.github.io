Good God, I love this language.
It's somewhat of an acquired taste but I've drank so much of it that I can't
stop now. I'm not sure that it should actually be used in production because I
think that it's best suited to prototyping. Playing type-whack-a-mole isn't very
fun.

In C++ spirit, it doesn't force you to use any particular programming paradigm
but there is a little emphasis on prototype based and object oriented
programming.

I've done some doomed things in this language because of how permissive it is.
Check them out, then replace your eyes:
