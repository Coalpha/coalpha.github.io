# haskell

This language feels like it's standing on top of a tall mountain.
It sneers at all those non 10x-ers who can't even understand what's so wonderful
about magical functional programming.
I can see *some* of the benefits to Haskell but it just feels like I'm not smart
enough to use it.
Getting something to compile is an achievement because I have no idea what I'm
doing.
This is not haskell's fault, but it hurts my self esteem when I using it.
`Maybe` some day I'll revisit it and discover the meaning of life or something.
