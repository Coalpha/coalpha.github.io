# typescript

TypeScript gives me blue balls. It's like almost good enough and nearly has all
of the type power that you want and then it falls flat on it's face. MICROSOFT
is *teasing* me with this stuff. Give me my compile time generic programming.
C++ templates aren't *that* bad, are they?

## give me

<sub>in no particular order</sub>

- typelevel number arithmetic
- string introspection and mapping at compile time
- higher kinded types
- proper newtypes
- a way to generate compile time errors
- `infer T` without `extends?:`
- uint, int, float
- optimizing compiler
