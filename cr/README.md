# crystal

Crystal has syntax that makes me wish it wasn't purely Object Oriented.
If Crystal was a procedural language, it would probably be one of my favorite
languages to program in.
This language hits an interesting sweet spot.
It's really easy to translate programs written in Perl to Crystal for some
reason.
Binaries from Crystal's compiler are fast but it's so slow to compile.
Crystal's editor support is lacking which makes it difficult for a newbie like
myself.
I always need to have the API webpage open since I can't just autocomplete
things or check method arguments through VSCode.
