# dart

Dart is an interesting language.
It's kinda like a mash of C, Java, and TypeScript.
I think it's actually a really good language with a cool ecosystem.
It seems like Dart is being used mostly for Android applications right now using
something called "Flutter".
I dunno what it is but people seem to like it.
As I don't own an Android, I don't care about apps for it at all.
Dart is like better JavaScript.
It doesn't make radical changes to the syntax so it's familiar.
The thing is that I know most of the JavaScript APIs pretty well.
It's a nice language.
Just not enough to spend my time learning things I already know how to do
in JavaScript or TypeScript.
