# snake language

Before I understood the object model, I kinda hated python for no other reason
than "I don't know how it works so it sucks". Sure, there are legitimate reasons
to dislike this language. Package management, virtual envs, and Jupyter come to
mind. But it's about as dynamic in nature as JavaScript, maybe even a little
more, actually. It's not immune to curse, by any means. It just seems like most
people who use it don't really take time to cause curse. Don't worry, I'll do
enough to make up for everyone else.
