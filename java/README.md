# Java

Okay, everyone hates on this language but I quite like it.
The memory usage isn't great and it's slow to start but once it's going, it's
like a tank rolling down a hill. The syntax is fine, and I don't actually mind
the OOP but I do mind the `null`. I hate that cursed `null`. At least Microsoft
Java fixes this with the whole nullable thing goddamn.
