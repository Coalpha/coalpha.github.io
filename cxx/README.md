# C++

This is where I test out new things that I learn in C++ now.
Before, it was mostly for helping other people out with their code.

This language has quickly became one of my favorites.
It's literally the most powerful thing that I've ever used.
I love pushing languages to the extreme and boy oh boy, does this language get
extreme. I think it might be interesting to go through my commit history on here
and watch as the C++ I write gets more and more cursed as time goes on.
