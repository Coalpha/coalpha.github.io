# C++

When I use C++, I feel like I have a lot of choice on how to write things.
It doesn't constrain me to any particular code style, or programming paradigm.
However, I believe that this is also what makes the language so cursed.
Since there are several different ways to do anything, the language gets more
complex and hard to understand.
Maybe my brain isn't large enough to understand what everything's for.
This language could use a good flensing and I'll probably stay far far away from
it.
