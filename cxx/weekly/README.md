# cxx_weekly

Yesterday evening on 22 Mar 2021, I happened across a video titled
"C++ Weekly - Ep 188 - C++20's \`constexpr\` \`new\` Support" while trying to
learn more about type erasure in C++. And well, this seems like the YouTube
equivalent of what I'm doing in here. I'm going to go through notable episodes
and try to make examples of the concepts (not that type) presented in the video.

I recommend running them using the `Makefile` at the root of this project.

```shell
make cxx_weekly~2
```
