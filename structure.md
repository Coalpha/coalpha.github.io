# Here's some general rules on how to name folders and files

### Folders
1. kebab-case
2. camelCase
3. PascalCase
4. snake_case
Exceptions to this rule are folders that contain Ruby or Rust. Those folders should *always* use `snake_case`

### Files
* `.min.js` files do not get `linted` by the `coalpha.github.io` repo's `.eslintrc`
* Version numbers should look like this: `0.0.0.*`
* JavaScript files should always use either `kebab-case` or `camelCase` (he says while typing "JavaScript" in `PascalCase`)
