# programming paradigms

Programming paradigms are a way for the programmer to think about the structure and implemenation of their program.

At the lowest level, the processor sees instructions. That's all there is to it.


## imperative

### procedural

This is the closest representation of what the processor does.
You tell it to do something and it does.

### object oriented
Object oriented languages are wonderful since they force you to think about your program a certain way.
Getting caught up in the details of implementation is something that I struggle with.
Object oriented allows you to write the worst code while making it seem good on the outside.
You don't need to be fully awake to program either since the language removes meta-abstract thinking.

On the other hand, there's something inherently cursed with binding data to the functions that act upon said data.
Mutation of your object is also an issue since you'll never know if another method touched your object in an inappropriate way.

#### Pros:
 - Really easy to think about

#### Both:
 - You can write the worst code
 - Mutation ( fast ) ( non-deterministic )

#### Cons:
 - Very corporate
 - Unfriendly to scripting
