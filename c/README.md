# C

This language is one of my favorites so far.
That being said, I've never worked on large projects with it.

Since it's so good, there are easy to identify annoyances that I'll list:

- Pointer syntax is weird
- Namespacing would be cool but I'm glad C doesn't have it
- You shouldn't have to guard your headers
- `int[] ary` instead of `int ary[]` would be cool
- The `[]` syntax should only be allowed when you know the size of the array
- `auto` should do what it does in `C++`
- Debugging kinda sucks but I get why

Other than that, I think it's done everything quite well.
I feel like you could argue that macros are bad but they're one of my guilty
pleasures.
