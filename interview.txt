When would you use video conferencing?
- To talk with people that I've never seen in a while.
- Maybe to see a loved one's face or something while they're overseas or something.
- I wouldn't use it normally. I guess I've only used it when my friends say that I should?
- I don't actually use video chat that frequently. I tend to use screen-sharing a lot.
- Work, and group projects.
- Family members who aren't in the area.
- I use it to talk to my friends
- Used to use video conferencing
- Talking for family when they're far away
- Good for teaching when there's someone who can't come into a class
- Close friends

Do you have an app that you already use?
- Discord
- Hangouts
- Skype
- Messenger
- Facetime
- Snapchat
- Oovoo

Are there any issues with this app?
- I wish screen sharing shared desktop audio.
- Skype can't work with multiple people's faces. Same with facetime.
- [Facetime] works very poorly on bad internet connections.
- [Facetime] works.
- Skype's quality just wasn't good enough to maintain a good connection between friends.

Do you wish this app had more features or was easier to use. Perhaps you're happy with it?

What do you like about this app?
- I like how [Discord] has many features and allows me to control things at a very granular level.
- I mean, I just think that Discord is well built.
- Skype has been around for a while. It works great for a one on one talk. If I want to talk to multiple people, I'll probably opt for discord.
- Oovoo could display many people's faces at once.
- It works with anyone who has an iPhone.

What would your ideal video conferencing app look like?
- Since I only use video conferencing when my friends say that I should, I'd like it to be simple and easy to use.
- I like to have a lot of control and flexibility when I use an application. It should be well built but also have many options.
- I think that I like the way that discord does it because it's got more control over everything, rather than the application assuming that you like these settings.
- Like a YouTube live-steam but both ways. Smart compression. Choose what video feed you're sending. Camera Screen etc...
- I want a lot of features IF I WANT IT. Like MacOS.
- I want easy to use and a lot of features.
